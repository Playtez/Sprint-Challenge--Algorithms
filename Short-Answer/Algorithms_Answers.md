#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) run time = O(n)
  one while loop moving in a linear fashion


b) run time = o(n^2)
    nested loop causing it to run n^2 of time


c) run time = O(n)
  as the number of bunnies increase so does the output other wise known as linear

## Exercise II

   
    - low will be the lowest floor
    - high will be the highest floor 
    - middle floor is the low floor divided by the high floor
    - divide the nth building in half
    - check to see if an egg is broken
    - if it doesnt break 
      - set low floor to the middle
      - and divide again
    - if an egg does break
      - assign the floor to it 
      - and divide in half again 
    - else return floor
